Here I used the PLNT16 tab and the GNE16 tab for analysis.

#Research questions:
1. Is there an installation time trend for generator annual net generation? (New power generators tend to have higher or lower capacity overtime?)
2. Is there a spatial distribution pattern of Power Plants in U.S.? (Number of power plants/ Total Electricity Generation/ CO2 emission in each state ~ States)
